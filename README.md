# TASK-INTERN-CAREER
This repository is for all Data Analysis projects that I carried out as an Intern at Intern Career.

## YOUTUBE STREAMERS' ANALYSIS:
The first project was the YouTube Streamer Analysis, which was executed using Python. This particular project delved into the following:
1. Identifying trends among top YouTube streamers
2. Finding a correlation between the number of subscribers, likes, or comments
3. Analyzing the distribution of streamers' audiences by country and regional preferences
These and many more are contained in this insightful analysis.

## TRENDS IN GLOBAL TERRORISM:
The second project visualizes trends in global terrorism for 47 years (1979-2017). This dashboard contains information about terrorist attacks worldwide. It includes details such as the dates of attack, location, attack type, number of casualties, terror group, etc. This insightful dashboard is interactive and seeks to understand and explain the trend over time in attacks carried out by terror groups, the weapons they used, the civilian casualties, and the success of their attacks. 
Explore this interactive dashboard to understand and unearth intricate details about global terrorism.
